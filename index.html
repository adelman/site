            I've worked on a few projects, for university, personal use, and
            freelanced for other parties. While in college I took an interest
            in functional languages, specifically <a
              href="http://www.smlnj.org/" target="_blank" title="The SML of NJ
              home page.">SML</a>.  I took an individual tutorial to explore
            the work of Chris Okasaki in his book
            <em>Purely Functional Data Structures</em>. One of the more
            interesting implementations was Binary Random Access Lists. Since
            there are no references in a functional setting, we use lists of
            Leaf complete binary trees with special properties to give us
            guaranteed logarithmic access and updating to any item in the
            list.</p>
 
            <p align="justify"> Recently, I've been working on a few side
            projects using the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/"
              target="_blank" title="The Ruby on Rails home page."
              >Ruby on Rails</a> framework. My first Rails project can be found
            <a
              target="_blank" href="mxadelman.herokuapp.com"
              title="Conception Connection">here</a>. It is called "Conception
            Connection, and is based off of <a target="_blank"
            href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2922#comic"
              title="The comic.">SMBC 2922</a>, one of my favorite web comics.
            This served as a chance for me to get to knows Rails a little bit,
            as well as an excuse to learn a little bit about web scraping.
            Since then, I also did a big project for the Wesleyan Costume Shop.
            This involved more database work, and mailers. In addition, I
            created a contract manager for the restaurant I managed while in
            college. These projects are not linked to, because they are
            private. In addition, I have designed a few static pages for people
            using Bootstrap. </p>

            <p>
            My biggest project in University was was an implementation of <a
            target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)"
            title="A description of the algorithm.">RSA</a> and a revisit of the
            Lenstra et al. paper <a target="_blank" href=
            "http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/064.pdf"
            title= "The paper with which our project was concerned."
            >Ron was wrong, Whit is right</a> . This was a
            group project and our implementation can be found <a
            href="http://carmi.github.com/rsa/code/" target="_blank"
            title= "A JavaScript implementation of RSA.">here</a>. The main idea
            was that we
            tried to get as many of the certifications from the top 1,000,000
            websites as we could, and then do an analysis using the Euclidean
            lgorithm to attempt to find pairs of bad moduli. Our method and
            results can all be found on my GitHub.  </p>      

            <p align="justify"> Again while in college, I developed an interest
            for experimental algorithmics and code tuning. I worked on a
            project to find the value at which it is better to use insertion
            sort than quick sort. Little things like this, which when used
            correctly make a vast improvement to the overall performance of a
            well known algorithm, fascinate me. I love working on interesting
            problems and the occasional hacking together a script to make
            something easier for me. </p>

          <p align="justify"> Some of my favorite topics in math are Number
          Theory, Real Analysis and Algebraic Geometry. In my opinion, number
          theory has the most immediate and apparent real world applications.
          Specifically, most of modern cryptography has its roots in number
          theory. However, my real interest lies in the prime numbers. I am
          endlessly fascinated by the primes both because of their duality in
          both being so heavily studied, and yet, we know almost nothing about
          how they occur. It's the features like this that really drew me into
          this branch of math and got me hooked. For real analysis, I must say I
          really like the fundamentals.  Starting off with basically nothing, it
          gives you the technology to say so much about the real numbers, and
          real valued functions. The completeness axioms are some of my
          favorites.  </p>
          <p align="justify"> This just leaves us with algebraic geometry. Now I
          did take Abstract Algebra, but it didn't really capture my attention.
          However I must be a visual person, because this class was fantastic.
          Theorems like <a target="_blank" title="The statement of the theorem."
          href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HilbertsNullstellensatz.html"
          >Hilbert's Nullstellensatz</a>, and using affine varietes to prove the
          fundamental theorem of algebra is what really caught me. My final
          project for that class was a group project where we discussed the
          resolution of singularities, including blow-ups and <a target="_blank"
          title="A full description of the theorem." href=
          "http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2003-40-03/S0273-0979-03-00982-0/S0273-0979-03-00982-0.pdf">Hironaka's method</a>. In addition to these courses I 
          have also taken
          Differential Equations, Discrete Math and Graduate Algebra as
          electives. I plan to take Mathematical Logic in the Spring. Both of
          the above graphics come from my Multivariable Calculus class.  </p>

          <h3 id="photo" align="center">Photography</h3>
          <p align="justify"> I have had the great fortune of being able to
          visit many countries around the world, and it was on these trips, that
          I developed my love for nature photography. There is a certain thrill
          that comes with it. You can't simply tell the animal how to stand,
          or hope the sun will be just right for a shot of a landscape. If you
